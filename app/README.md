# Using the JavaScript lookup tool

Having installed [pyconcepticon](https://github.com/concepticon/pyconcepticon/),
you can populate this folder with the data required to use the JavaScript-based
lookup tool (see also [this blog post](https://calc.hypotheses.org/1820#more-1820)):

```
concepticon app --repos=.
```

(or a different path for `--repos` if you're not in the concepticon-data
repository)

Afterwards, open `index.html` with your favourite browser, e.g.:

```
firefox index.html
```
