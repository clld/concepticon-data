Wang-2004-471	Wang, Feng	2004		471	questionnaire,basic	English,Chinese	Bai dialects (Tibeto-Burman)		Wang2004b		This concept list was used for a study on Bai dialects, based on original field work by the author. The thesis was published officially two years later ([Wang 2006](:bib:Wang2006)), potentially with small modifications. The seemingly inconsistent numbering of concepts indicates a probably larger questionnaire underlying the data which was published in the end. In some cases, English glosses were missing or not complete. We have added them and indicated this by putting them in square brackets.		
Bodt-2019-664	Bodt, Timotheus A. and List, Johann-Mattis	2019		664	questionnaire,proto-language	English	Kho-Bwa (Tibeto-Burman)		Bodt2019		This list was extracted from a larger questionnaire for fieldwork of the Western Kho-Bwa languages and later assembled for a prediction experiment.		
Sagart-2019-250	Sagart, Laurent and Jacques, Guillaume and Lai, Yunfan and Ryder, Robin and Thouzeau, Valentin and Greenhill, Simon J. and List, Johann-Mattis	2019		250	basic	English	Sino-Tibetan	http://dighl.github.io/sinotibetan/	Sagart2019		This list was used for a phylogenetic study on Sino-Tibetan languages. As the items were selected by taking the list of [Huang et al. (1992)](:ref:Huang-1992-1820) as reference, it also indicates to which item of this list the supposed items correspond.	242-253	
SoHartmann-1988-280	So-Hartmann, Helga	1988		280	basic	English	Chin varieties (Tibeto-Burman)		SoHartmann1988		This list was used for a study of Chin varieties, which was later digitized as part of the [STEDT](https://stedt.berkeley.edu/) project.		
Castro-2010-540	Andy Castro and Brian Crook and Royce Flaming	2010		540	questionnaire	English,Chinese	Zhuang dialects (Tai-Kadai)		Castro2010a		This list provides a rather large range of concepts used for a mutual intelligibility survey of Zhuang dialects of the Hongshui He area. 	60-107	
Castro-2010-511	Castro, Andy and Hansen, Bruce	2010		511	questionnaire	English,Chinese	Yi dialects (Tibeto-Burman)		Castro2010		This list was used for a sociolinguistic survey of closely related Yi varieties spoken in the Heqing province in Yunnan (China).	61-92	
Chen-2012-888	Chén, Qíguāng 陳其光	2012		888	questionnaire	Chinese	Hmong-Mien languages		Chen2012		This very long and only partially linked list is based on a survey of Hmong-Mian languages, which was particularly focusing on historical language comparison. The English glosses were added by us, by comparing specifically which glosses other scholars from China used in their collections where they provided English glosses.	567-862	
Huang-1992-1820	Huáng, Bùfán 黃布凡	1992		1820	questionnaire	Chinese,English	Sino-Tibetan languages		Huang1992		This extremely long and only marginally linked concept list is taken from the very influential survey of Sino-Tibetan (or Tibeto-Burman) languages published in 1992. The data has also been digitized by the [STEDT](https://stedt.berkeley.edu/) project, but in this version, the Chinese elicitation glosses are not provided. For the version we list here, Doug Cooper provided a digitized version of the Chinese glosses. 	1-608	TBL
Lama-2012-301	Lama, Ziwo Qiu-Fuyuan	2012		301	basic, proto-language	Chinese,English	Yi (Tibeto-Burman)		Lama2012		This list was used for the initial proposal of a subgrouping for the Nisoic or Yi subgroup of Tibeto-Burman. The numbering starts with 0, which is why the list contains a total of 300 items. Data was taken from different sources, which may also have influenced the choice of concepts.		
Walworth-2018-215	Walworth, Mary and Shimelman, Aviva	2018		215	basic,areal	English,Bislama	Vanuatu languages		Walworth2018		This list is closely related to the basic wordlist of the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database](:ref:Blust-2008-210), but it lists additional personal pronouns.		Vanuatu Basic Words
Hale-1973-1798	Hale, Austin	1973		1798	questionnaire,areal	English	Languages spoken in Nepal		Hale1973		This huge questionnaire is based on a large survey of languages in Nepal.		
Castro-2015-608	Castro, Andy and Pan, Xingwen	2015		608	questionnaire,areal	English,Chinese	Sui	https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/64425	Castro2015	Castro2015	This large concept list was used as the basis for a detailed investigation of Sui dialects. The study was first published in Chinese and later translated into English. Andy Castro was so friendly to share his bilingual concept list with us. This facilitated the concept mapping process greatly, although we could not map all concepts to Concepticon.	377-382	
Perrin-2010-110	Perrin, Loïc-Michel	2010		110	annotated	English,German,French	Global	https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/xmlpage/1/article/353?htmlOnce=yes	Perrin2010	Perrin2010	This list was used as an initial questionnaire for colexification studies on a world-wide sample of languages.	276f	
Sun-1991-1004	Sun, Hongkai et al.	1991		1004	questionnaire	English,Chinese	Tibeto-Burman languages	http://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl	Sun1991		This concept list originally served as a questionnaire for a large-scale investigation on Tibeto-Burman languages. The original questionnaire was in Chinese with no English translation. Later the [STEDT project](:bib:Matisoff2015) digitized the data, translating Chinese concept labels to English, but not listing the original Chinese forms. As a result, some concept labels are identical, although they are different in the Chinese version. We are still trying to add the original Chinese concept labels to this resource, but for the moment, we only link the STEDT version, occasionally adding Chinese concept labels, where we figure they are important to distinguish the original meaning.		
Robinson-2012-398	Robinson, Laura C and Holton, Gary	2012		398	basic	English	Alor-Pantar languages	http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22105832-20120201	Robinson2012		The authors inform that the list is built upon the about 400 items of [Holton (2012)](:bib:Holton2012), but this source did not submit the dataset.		
Heggarty-2017-200	Heggarty, Paul and Anderson, Cormac and Scarborough, Matthew	2017		200	basic	English	Indo-European languages	http://cobl.clld.org	Heggarty2017		This is the basic list of 200 items which were selected for the Cognates in Basic Lexicon project. The compilers selected the items following various different criteria, such as ease of elicitation, non-fuzziness of the meaning, representation in Indo-European languages, and more. The numbers are at times higher than 200. This results from the earlier selection which containted more concepts which were no longer used in the official version.		
Hill-2017-240	Hill, Nathan W. and List, Johann-Mattis	2017		240	basic,areal	English	Burmish languages	https://zenodo.org/record/886116	Hill2017		This list is a small subset of the larage list of almost 2000 items which was used for the survey of Sino-Tibetan languages by [Huáng (1992)](:bib:Huang1992), usually called the *Tibet-Burman lexicon* or simply abbreviated as TBL. The authors slightly modified the glosses in their investigation of Burmish languages in the TBL, but the links to the are added in the column TBL_ID.		
Serva-2012-200	Serva, Maurizio  and Petroni, Filippo and Volchenkov, Dima  and Wichmann, Søren	2012		200	basic	English	Malagasy dialects	http://people.disim.univaq.it/%7Eserva/languages/english.html	Serva2012		This list which resembles Swadesh's list of [200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) closely, was compiled for a study of several varieties of Malagasy dialects. Given that we only had the concept labels for linking, and nobody of the current team knows much about Malagasy dialects, the linking may be sub-optimal at times, and if users detect errors or have suggestions on refinements, we would be very glad if they contacted us.		
Bender-1971-99	Bender, M. L.	1971		99	basic	English	Ethiopian	https://www.jstor.org/stable/30029540?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents	Bender1971	Bender1971	This list of 99 concepts for a lexical study on Ethiopian is mainly based on the classical [Swadesh list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100).	169	
Dellert-2017-1016	Dellert, Johannes and Jäger, Gerhard	2017		1016	questionnaire	English,German,Russian	North-Eurasian languages	http://www.northeuralex.org	Dellert2017		This huge dataset lists translations for as many as 1016 concepts into more than 100 North-Eurasian languages. Concept sets have been linked to the Concepticon with help of the editors of the database, and since more than 200 concepts were not yet included in the Concepticon, this greatly increased the number of concept sets which we have by now. The data is further ranked, following some kind of stability score which was based on a method presented in [Dellert and Buch 2016](:bib:Dellert2016). The data are available from the columns RANK and STABILITY_SCORE. Currently, we do not yet display the weblinks to the online application, but only the internal ID, which can be retrieved from the downloadable data in CLDF format from the website.		
Ray-1895-26	Ray, Sidney H.	1895		26	ultra-stable,areal	English	Britich New Guina Languagse (Melanesian and Papuan)		Ray1895	Ray1895	This early concept list was compiled to study genetic relationships among languages of New Guinea. The author reports himself that he was specifically looking into words of common usage in order to determine whether they are related among different branches.	33-39	
Backstrom-1992-210a	Backstrom, Peter C. and Radloff, Carla F.	1992	a	210	basic,areal	English	Pakistanian languages		Backstrom1992	Backstrom1992	This list was compiled for a sociolinguistic survey of language use in Pakistan. The list of 210 items is supposed to represent a standardized list used to investigate all languages in the field work survey. However, as can be seen when comparing the official list of 210 items with the concept labels given in the concrete surveys on specific language families, as the list of [Balti dialects](:ref:Backstrom-1992-210b), it becomes obvious that not only some items are missing, but also that certain meanings have been modified, probably in order to make sure that enough words could be elicited. Although all glosses for «verbal meanings» are highly complex, we link them all to the basic concept sets, since from the survey it is clear that the authors adjusted them in order to elicite those verbal forms which represent the root of a given concept most consistently.	209-214	
Backstrom-1992-210b	Backstrom, Peter C. and Radloff, Carla F.	1992	b	205	basic,areal	English	Balti dialects		Backstrom1992		This is the concrete list which was used for Balti dialects (Tibetan group of Sino-Tibetan) in the large survey of languages in Pakistan (see the [general list of 210 items used in this survey](:ref:Backstrom-1992-210a)). The list is missing five entries and shows also some further differences from the main list. Since we kept the numbering of both the standardized list and the concrete questionnaire used for the Balti dialects, those differences can be easily spotted when comparing the lists.	219-233	
Bowern-2012-644	Bowern, Claire	2012		644	questionnaire	English	Tasmanian		Bowern2012a		This list supplements a study on Tasmanian languages based on various sources. It provides a linking between different concept labels found in various sources on Tasmanian languages. Due to the specificity of the vocabulary, we had to leave many concepts unlinked.		
Bowern-2017-348	Bowern, Claire	2012		348	questionnaire	English	Pama-Nyungan	https://zenodo.org/record/1005671	Bowern2012b		This lists supplements [Bowern and Atkinson's (2012)](:bib:Bowern2012) study and contains material from both Swadesh's [200-item list](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and the [questionnaire for hunter gatherer languages](:ref:Bowern-2011-204).		
Kingsada-1999-303	Kingsada, Thongpheth and Shintani, Tadahiko	1999		303	basic	English	South-East Asia		Kingsada1999		This list was used for a survey of basic vocabulary of 17 language varieties spoken in the border region between China and Vietnam. The list itself references an earlier list by [Shintani and Yang (1990)](:bib:Shintani1990), which itself goes back to an even earlier larger list of concepts used for lexical field work of Chinese dialects. The last two lists are not yet available for the Concepticon, but we add the reference number in the column Shintani1990 (items with ID 999999 seem to indicate that this concept does not occur in the master list and was added for the survey).		
Calude-2011-200	Calude, Andreea S. and Pagel, Mark	2011		200	basic	English	cross-linguistic sample		Calude2011		This list is identical with the one by [Pagel et al. 2007](:ref:Pagel-2007-200), but it adds additional metadata, namely frequency counts for the 200 items for as many as 17 different languages. We list the logged frequencies of the basic words, leaving those cases where the authors did not find the respective word frequencies empty.		
BeijingDaxue-1964-905	{Beijing University}	1964		905	areal	Chinese	Chinese dialects		BeijingDaxue1964		This questionnaire was employed for one of the first large-scale dialect surveys in China, notably a survey that was based on lexical data, not solely on character readings. Unfortunately, the concepts themselves are very idiosyncratic and we had to omit many of those terms, as it would have been too tedious add them to the Concepticon right now.		Cihui
Daniels-2016-85	Daniels, Don	2016		85	basic,areal,documentation	English	New Guinea	http://muse.jhu.edu/article/619290	Daniels2016	Daniels2016	This list is supposed to reflect [Swadesh's concept list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), although it deviates from the original concept labels. It was used to compare a so far undocumented language from Papua New Guina (Magɨ) with a potentially related language (Aisi). Certain concepts were excluded from the list, mostly due to dependencies with other concepts due to colexification and compounding.	219-221	
Swadesh-1964-100	Swadesh, Morris	1964		100	basic	English,Russian	Global	http://www.classes.ru/grammar/148.new-in-linguistics-1/source/worddocuments/_24.htm	Swadesh1964		This is the famous [100 item Swadesh list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) in the first Russian translation. This list contains the 92 most stable items from the [master list of 215 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-215) plus eight additional items which are only mentioned in the text and are indicated here by starring the English concept label.	78-87	Swadesh-100-Russian
Swadesh-1960-215	Swadesh, Morris	1960		215	basic	Russian,English	Global	http://www.classes.ru/grammar/148.new-in-linguistics-1/source/worddocuments/_24.htm	Swadesh1964		This is the first Russian translation of the master list of [Swadesh's paper from 1955](:bib:Swadesh1955), which turned out to be very influential in Soviet linguistics and has retained influential up to today. Note that while the translation of the concept labels is literal and also provides the original ones which Swadesh provided in his c[master list of 215 concepts](:ref:Swadesh-1955-215), the Russian translation makes certain distinctions which cannot be determined from the original text. In one case, in the case of “fat”, this distinction is essentially wrong, as Swadesh did explicitly annotate this concept as a body part or substance. The concepts whose English labels are preceded by an asterisk are those 92 concepts which were later included in the famous [100-item list](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100).	78-87	
Wilkins-1996-75	Wilkins, David P.	1996		75	body parts,specific	English	Global		Wilkins1996	Wilkins1996	This collection shows cross-linguistically frequent pathways of semantic change which involve one item of the [list of 41 body part terms](:ref:Wilkins-1996-41) by the same compiler. The network is displayed by showing to which *target* a given concept links, with multiple targets being separated by a comma.	284	Wilkins-75
Wilkins-1996-41	Wilkins, David P.	1996		41	body parts,specific	English	Global		Wilkins1996	Wilkins1996	This collection of body part concepts was used for a cross-linguistic study of semantic change.	271	Wilkins-41
Peiros-1999-100	Peiros, Ilia	1999		100	basic	English	Global		Peiros1999	Peiros1999	This list is supposed to reflect Swadesh's original [basic list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet it contains many additional specifications in the concept labels, which at times also differ from the concepts which Swadesh had originally in mind.	291	
Campbell-1999-100	Campbell, Lyle	1999		100	basic	English	Global		Campbell1999	Campbell1999	This list is supposed to replicate the standard list of [100 items by Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). It differs in the concept labels, however, and also in the ordering of concepts.	178	
Birchall-2016-125	Birchall, Joshua and Dunn, Michael and Greenhill, Simon J.	2016		125	areal	English	Chapacuran		Birchall2016		This list is the concept list underlying a comparative analysis of Chapacuran languages. The original data lists the concepts, but splits them into 285 cognate sets, occasionally allowing for variation in meaning. We ignored these variations and linked the concepts according to the basic meaning as further exemplified in the supplementary material of the study.		
Snoek-2013-61	Snoek, Conor	2013		61	body parts,specific	English	Athapaskan langauges		Snoek2013	Snoek2013	This concept list provides a list of general body part terms, including proper body parts, body liquids, and what the compiler calls ephemera, that is, alienable parts of the human body. The list is of specific interest as it is one of the rare explicit accounts we could find so far, where body part terminology is nearly exhaustively listed.	244	Snoek-body-parts
Wang-2015-62	Wang, Feng	2015		62	basic,stable	English,Chinese	Miao-Yao, Chinese		Wang2015		This list is supposed to represent a list of stable lexical items which are reflected in a larger range of Miao-Yao languages in form of regular sound correspondences in stable form-meaning relations.	170-175	
Matisoff-2009-47	Matisoff, James A.	2009		47	basic,stable	English	Tibeto-Burman	https://minpaku.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_uri&item_id=2578&file_id=18&file_no=1	Matisoff2009		This list proposes the most stable concepts for Tibeto-Burman, as reflected in reconstrutions with wide-spread reflexes. The concepts themselves are sometimes further broadened in the actual examples, showing complex patterns of semantic change that the author assumes. They are listed in the column REFLEX_MEANINGS in the data. The two personal pronouns are starred, as the author does not give the literal forms in the paper.	299-307	
Hooley-1971-128	Hooley, Bruce A.	1971		128	basic,areal	English	Austronesian		Hooley1971	Hooley1971	 This list is based on [Bee (1962)](:bib:Bee1962), and it contains a selection of 128 of those original 176 words, due to the criterion of 'elicitability' in a field work survey. Further 28 items were discarded, since they did not find a word in the given varieties.	109-111	
Rea-1958-100	Rea, John A.	1958	1	100	basic	English	Romance languages		Rea1958	Rea1958	This list is basically identical with the list of [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) and was used to test the stability of lexical items in the Romance languages.	148	
Mennecier-2016-183	Phillipe Mennecier and John Nerbonne and Evelyne Heyer and Franz Manni	2016		183	basic	English,Russian	Russian,Turkic	https://figshare.com/articles/A_Central_Asian_Language_Survey/3443090/1	Mennecier2016		This concept list was underlying a study on Central Asian language varieties (mostly Turkic and Russian dialects). The data description is a bit confusing, as the authors list in their abstract that they used a [Swadesh list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) which they reduced to 176 items. In the supplementary table 1, they then mention that they excluded 21 of the 200 concepts, but they do not mention that they added to more concepts (AUTUMN and BUTTERFLY) in the table they show in supplementary material 1, and the total number of concepts expected in this table is also not 181, but 188, so they obviously used the [combined Swadesh list 207 items](:bib:Comrie1977). In the supplementary table 2, however, there are only 183 concepts, which we now list as such in our Concepticon. The column ENGLISH_1 corresponds to the summary table in supplementary table 1, from where we also took the Russian translations.		
Liu-2007-201	Liú, Lìlǐ 刘俐李 and Wáng, Hóngzhōng 王洪钟 and Bǎi, Yíng 柏莹	2007		201	basic	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		Liu2007	Liu2007	"This list is based on the [200 item list of Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). The reason why it contains 201 items is that the word for """"RIVER"""" occurs twice, reflecting the two opposed terms *hé* and *jiāng*. Since these are merely regional terms both existing only in the cultural context of China, we link them to the same concept set. Nevertheless, the list still contains 201 items, as the item """"count"""" in the data is listed both as a noun and a verb, with the noun then translating as """"number"""". In Chinese dialects, the words for *number* and *count* are essentially the same, but they often show a difference in tone. "	32-132	
Cysouw-2006-110	Cysouw, Michael and Wichmann, Søren and Kamholz, David	2006		110	basic	English	Mixe-Zoque		Cysouw2006		This list is almost completely identical with the origignal [110 item list by Starostin (1991)](:ref:Starostin-1991-110). It was used for a lexicostatistical investigation of 10 Mixe-Zoque languages.	259-261	
Deepadung-2015-100	Deepadung, Sujaritlak and Buakaw, Supakit and Rattanapitak, Ampika	2015		100	areal,basic	English	Palaung (Austroasiatic)	http://www.sealang.net/mks/mks44sujaritlak.pdf	Deepadung2015		This list consists of 100 items which were taken from the comparative basic list by [Mann (2004)](:ref:Mann-2004-500), consisting of 118 items which occur both in the list by [Matisoff (1978)](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200)the different lists of Swadesh ([1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200)). While this list contains 118 items, the authors only chose the first 100 of those.	33-38	
List-2016-57	List, Johann-Mattis	2016		57	areal,basic	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		List2016f	List2016f	This list was created for an experiment on ancestral state reconstruction in Chinese dialects. It is originally based on a 200 concept list by [Wang (2006)](:ref:Wang-2006-200) and our version of the list shows the link to the original entries. The list is a collection of nouns which are all reconstructible back to Old Chinese, that is, following the annotation of the data provided in [Hamed and Wang (2006)](:bib:Hamed2006), the words expressing the concepts in Old Chinese have survived in at least one of the Chinese dialects in the same meaning.	129	
List-2016-180	List, Johann-Mattis	2016		180	areal,basic	English,Chinese	Chinese dialects		List2016g		"This list was taken from the supplementary material of a study on partial cognate detection and comprises a larger concept lists, the [Hànyǔ Fāngyán Cíhuì](:bib:Cihui] (1964), consisting of about 800 concepts which were translated into 18 dialect varieties. The smaller list of 180 concepts was selected with respect to the relative frequency of the concepts in other datasets. While the authors link to our Concepticon in their original publication, we re-adjusted some of their links, as it turned out they were either ambiguous or not precise enough. Thus, we linked """"left"""" to """"LEFT HAND"""", as the Chinese concept label in the original source and the dialect words suggest this reading. We also added information on the page number and the identification number in the original source of the Cíhuì."		
Heggarty-2014-110	Heggarty, Paul	2014		110	areal,stable	English	Germanic	http://alignments.lingpy.org/multiple.php?dataset=Germanic	List2014e		This list was originally proposed by Paul Heggarty to reflect the most stable words across Germanic languages and is now used in the [Sound Comparisons Projects](http://soundcomparisons.com/). The data for a couple of Germanic language varieties was further included in the [Benchmark Database of Phonetic Alignments](http://alignments.lingpy.org), from which we took the list we present here.		
Chacon-2014-142	Chacon, Thiago Costa	2014		142	areal	English	Tukano		Chacon2014		This list was underlying a detailed reconstruction of the consonant system of Proto-Tukano. The items in the list were selected for reasons of coverage in terms of cognate reflexes in the Tukanoan languages under investigation. The list was not officially published but kindly provided to us by the author.		
Kessler-2001-200	Kessler, Brett	2001		200	basic	English	global		Kessler2001		This list was used to test various methods for the proof of language relationship. It is supposed to follow strictly the [200-item list of Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200).	202-258	
Gregersen-1976-217	Gregersen, Edgar A.	1976		217	basic	English	African		Gregersen1976	Gregersen1976	This concept list is based on a merger of several concept lists proposed by Swadesh. As the compiler mentions himself, the list is composed of all 200 items proposed in [Swadesh (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), all additional items proposed in [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), and [Swadeshs supplementary list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100a). According to the annotation of the compiler, all items occuring in the 200-item list and the 100-item list are marked with one asterisk.

It is not clear on which criteria the author selected the meaning list. He quotes work of Shirō Hattori ([1961](:bib:Hattori1961)), and lists data presented in an earlier dictionary compiled by Hattori, but it is not clear whether the selection of meanings was also based on previous work.	99-114	
Lee-2013-200	Lee, S. and Hasegawa, Toshiharu	2013		200	basic	English,Japanese	Ainu		Lee2013		This list was used to study the evolution of the Ainu languages. It is almost completely identical with the list of [200 items by Hattori (1973)](:ref:Hattori-1973-200), but contains additional Japanese translations. The first author was so friendly to provide us with the concept list in digital form.		
Swadesh-1954-97	Swadesh, Morris	1954		97	basic	English	American Indian languages		Swadesh1954	Swadesh1954	"According to Swadesh, this list of 97 items was extracted from a larger collection of 120 wordlists in American Indian languages. The 97 items which Swadesh labeled as ""non-cultural"" seem to be a compromise between coverage and useful items for language comparison, which would also explain the rather strange number of 97 concepts."	316-318

Payne-1991-202	Payne, David L.	1991		202	specific	English	Arawakan		Payne1991	Payne1991	This concept list is extracted from a collection of lexical reconstructions of Proto-Arawakan along with their reflexes in 24 Arawakan languages. The concept labels are not always easy to interprete. The author mentions that labels in brackets result from meaning deviations in some of the reflexes, but this principle does not seem to have been followed up thoroughly all the time.	392-426

In contrast to the original ranking procedure, the results are calculated by averaging them. The Atlantic language data underlying the ranking covers etymological data for 41 different languages. Since we know that the concept labels in this list are meant to denote the same concepts as those presented in the list by [Starostin (2007)](:ref:Starostin-2007-110), there are some mappings which may seem unintuitive (""ground"" being mapped to ""EARTH (SOIL)""), since they result from different translations from the Russian source into English.  202"	200	
Alpher-1999-151	Alpher, Barry and Nash, David	1999		151	areal	English	Australian		Alpher1999	Alpher1999	This list was originally proposed in order to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Australian languages. The first 100 words constitute the list of [O'Grady and Klokeid in 1969](:ref:OGrady-1969-100); the next 20 are the words in Hale's (1961) list that are not also in O'Grady and Klokeid's; the next 25 are words in Black's (nd a.) list that are not in either of the above; the last 6 words (relevant for the most part in the monsoon tropics of Australia) are the authors' additions.	53-55	
Hale-1961-100	Hale, Kenneth L.	1961		100	areal	English	Australian		Alpher1999	Alpher1999	According to [Alpher and Nash (1999)](:bib:Alpher1999), this list has been created by K. Hale and is reflected in an unpublished resource from 1961.		
OGrady-1969-100	O'Grady, Geoffrey N. and Klokeid, Terry J.	1969		100	areal	English	Australian		OGrady1969	OGrady1969	This is one of the earlier lists proposed for comparative studies on Australian languages.

The list is essentially a merger of the classical lists of Swadesh ([1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100)) and Matisoff ([1978](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200)), though it does not follow any of them completely. Sidwell provides a comparison of his own list with the two classical lists by Swadesh, which is indicated in the additional columns.	lxxv-lxxvi

Blust-1981-200	Blust, Robert	1981		200	basic	English	Austronesian		Blust1981		This is the first version of Blust's modified list for lexicostatistical comparison which would later become the [210 item list](:ref:Blust-2008-210) of the [ABVD]() project. The list is mentioned in [Blust (2000)](:bib:Blust2000) yet it is not printed there, and it was prepared as a manuscript that was presented at a conference in 1981 but was never published. Robert Blust was so friendly to provide us with a digital version of his original list.		
Thomas-1979-34	Thomas, David	1979		34	areal	English	Bahnaric		Thomas1979	Thomas1979	This list contains words which are useful for the subgrouping of Bahnaric, since the main branches show divergent vocabulary items in these cases.	174-177	
Allen-2007-500	Allen, Brian	2007		500	questionnaire	English, Chinese	Bai		Allen2007		This list was taken as the reference for conducting field work on the Bai dialects, a minority language spoken in South-West China. Originally, 550 words were collected, but due to missing items in some of the languages of the survey, the list was further reduced to 500 languages.	69-113	
Bennett-1976-100	Bennett, Patrick R.	1976		100	areal	English	Bantu		Bennet1976		This list was created to carry out lexicostatistical studies of Bantu languages. Originally, it is divided into two parts, one for nouns ([163-165](:ref:Bennett-1976-50a)) and one for verbs ([166f](:ref:Bennett-1976-50b)). Here, we list both parts together.	163-167

The concept list itself is not given in the article but provided in the supplementary material.		
TeilDautrey-2008-430	Teil-Dautrey, Gisèle	2008		430	questionnaire	English	Bantu	https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/bantu/	Greenhill2008	Greenhill2008	The numbering of the concept list indicates 434 concepts in total. However, in our count and in the count on the website, only 430 items seem to have been defined. To our knowledge, there is no printed publication of the list of concepts. When mapping the concepts to the concepticon, we hade some problems in finding the correct mapping for quite a few concepts. So until we have carried out a proper re-checking of the data, asking the original authors of the concept list for help, the results of this mapping should be taken with a considerable amount of care. Since the [BBVD](https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/bantu/) was launched around the first time the [ABVD](https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/) was launched, we assign this source the same year in the reference as we assigned the [ABVD](https://abvd.shh.mpg.de/austronesian/).

Note that we failed to link quite a few of the words since they are not easy to be understood as concepts but rather as function words. Feel free to suggest revisions if you are not content with our current linking.		
Ogden-1930-200	Ogden, Charles Kay	1930		200	basic	English	Basic English	https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Basic_English_picture_wordlist	Ogden1930		This is but one part of the famous 850 words of Ogden's “Basic English”, which was intended to present a way to simplify English serving as a lingua franca. The original source could, unfortunately not be obtained, and so we only list 200 of the 850 words by Ogden, which we find interesting, since the author labelled them as “picturable words”, thus these words are supposed to be very concrete, and we provide additional links to representative images taking from the Simple English version of Wikipedia. Note that not all of the 200 words are listed on this page, with two words missing, so we added them and marked them by an asterisk to annotate that the image links do not originally stem from the page we give in the URL.		
Forni-2013-201	Forni, Gianfranco	2013		201	stable	English,Basque	Basque,Indo-European		Forni2013	Forni2013	This list is supposed to represent non-borrowed parts of Basque basic vocabulary. Since the list itself was based on reconstructions of Proto-Basque, it contains rather fuzzy concept labels which were not easy to resolve. To our knowledge, the list was created independently of any alternative work on concept lists, like, e.g., the work by Morris Swadesh.	98-103	
Mitterhofer-2013-95	Mitterhofer, Bernadette	2013		95	areal	English	Bena dialects		Mitterhofer2013	Mitterhofer2013	This is the short concept list used for a dialect survey of Bena dialects. Note that two items of the list are labeled as *a* and *b* respectively, which is why the real number of concept labels is not 94 but 95 items. Compare also the [long list of 300 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-300) which partially overlaps with this short list, and the [combined list of 355 items](:ref:Mitterhofer-2013-355) by the same author.	81-105	Mitterhofer-2013-94

Luqman-2010-65	Luqman, Hirzi	2010		65	areal	English	Bornean (Austronesian)		Luqman2010	Luqman2010	"This concept list consists of a small selection of the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary List](:ref:Blust-2008-210). The compiler lists different reasons for shortening the list for his phylogenetic study on Bornean languages, like *resistance to borrowing*, *distinctness of the meaning*, and gaps in the data. The compiler states that there are 64 items in the data and counts them accordingly. However, there is a counting error, since the item whith the number 27 is missing in the second table of the appendix. Judging from the first table, it should be ""mother"". Furthermore, the item ""Tongue"" is listed in the second table, but not in the first one, while ""grass"", listed in the first table, does not occur in the second one. We marked these three cases of inconsistencies with an asterisk in the gloss. "	A2f	
Mann-1998-406	Mann, Noel Walter	1998		406	areal,questionnaire	English	Burmish languages		Mann1998	Mann1998	This list was used to reconstruct Proto-North-Western Burmish, based on a comparison of several Burmish languages. The concept list itself is a 406 item list that was apparently created by the [SIL](http://sil.org) project as a specificic concept list for South-East Asia. This list itself exists in different versions, with the most recent one consisting of [436 items](:ref:SIL-2002-436). This latest list, however, is essentially identical with the earlier 406 item list, with only 30 additional concepts added in the end. Mann's concept list of 406 items is not complete, since he did not find forms for all of the words in the Burmish languages. Those forms are marked with an asterisk in our representation.	126-133

The wordlist itself is originally based on the list by [Swadesh (1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), but the author discarded the function words in the analysis and used also certain translations which diverge from the concepts originally proposed by Swadesh. Thus, instead of ""to know"" Zhēng uses ""to understand"" (Chinese *dǒng* 懂), and Chinese *rè* 熱 is better translated as ""hot"" than as ""warm"". In addition, Zhēng also offers semantic categories for the 86 concepts."	68

Note that what is labelled as ""common chinese"" in the list is a reconstruction system similar to that of Middle Chinese, but -- according to J. Norman -- less biased by the character readings of the traditional rhyme dictionaries published around 600 AD."	74f

The original publication itself is difficult to asses, as are the 60 items, but in this publicaton, the authors list all 60 concepts. Unfortunately we lack the images, which are usually given along with naming tests, so it was not possible to determine for all of the concepts, which one was actually meant, and we left these unlinked. The numbers in the column NUMBERS_INCORRECT reflect the percentage of people who named the items incorrectly in the test underlying the article.	106

This list is a subset of the concept list underlying the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2016-1310) and it offers an extended colexification analysis of all data underlying the 2007 version of the IDS along with data from different sources. Instead of providing full graphs for the networks, we provide links to the major clusters for each concept in CLICS. CLICS distinguishes two different kinds of cluster analyses: a community analysis, which can be accessed via the link in the ``CLUSTER_URL`` column, and a subgraph analysis, which can be accessed via the link in the ``SUBGRAPH_URL`` column. The column ``COMMUNITY_LABEL`` list the most central node in each of the community clusters in CLICS. The column ``FREQUENCY`` lists the number of times a translation for a given concept occurs in the CLICS data, and the columns ``DEGREE`` and ``WEIGHTED_DEGREE`` contains the unweighted and weighted degree for each node, the former referring to the number of concepts to which a given concept links, and the latter to the number of languages in which the concept links to any other concept.

The concept list itself is inspired by the list of the [Intercontinental Dictionary Series](:ref:Key-2016-1310) and the list of the [World Loanword Database](:ref:Haspelmath-2009-1460), but contains additional items which cannot be found on either of the two concept lists. The compiler lists findings regarding directed patterns of semantic change by providing source and target concept as well as the number of colexifications and the number of overtly marked cases. These patterns (a total of 47) are provided in the column ``SEMANTIC CHANGE``, where we list the number of the pattern in the source in square brackets, the source and the target concept, and the number of colexifications and overtly marked cases in normal brackets.	9-13, 46f

It thus defines additional metadata that may be useful for different purposes. Note that the linking to the Princeton Wordnet is not unique, but *one to many*: One concept of the original concept list may be linked to multiple senses of the Princeton Wordnet. The additional columns give the identifier used in the Intercontinental Dictionary Series (IDS_KEY), the Princeton Wordnet Word Sense (PWN_WORD_SENSE), the definition of the Princeton Wordnet (PWN_DEFINITION). As additional links which may turn out to be useful, we added the corresponding synsets of the Princeton Wordnet (PWN_SYNSET), the part of speech as defined for the synset by the Princeton Wordnet, and a weblink to the [Open Multilingual Wordnet](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/) (OMW_URL).

The original number of concepts is rather large (we counted as many as 2424 distinct glosses). In selecting only a subset of these, we hope to reduce the number of more or less identical concepts which are assigned different glosses and IDs in the database.

There are, however, some deviations from Swadesh's original concept labels, and these again show that the list of [Gudschinsky (1956)](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200) may have served as the base list for 200 of the 207 items. Since the list appears in an influential questionnaire for linguistic fieldwork, it can be expected that the impact of this list on fieldworkers was much higher than the impact of the original concept lists proposed by Swadesh.

Basically, it is identical with the one published in [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the labels in this list are simplified and not completely identical with the ones proposed before. In the version we consulted, some items seem to have been written in italic font, although we couldn't find any general pattern, what this practice might hint to. In order to keep as closely to the original, however, we marked all those entries with an asterisk.	273

It was supposed to be a pure merger of the concepts which Swadesh proposed in [1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). However, the editors did not notice (or deliberately ignored) that the former list explicitly lists the intransitive form of ""to burn"", while the latter lists ""to burn"" as transitive. Similar problems hold for ""rain"" which is explicitly labelled as a verb in the 200 item list, while no further specification is given in the 100 item list. One may of course say that these differences are minor ones, yet as a comparison with alternative approaches using the classical ""Swadesh list"" show, the incomplete descriptions of glosses have lead to a rather great degree of fuzziness in the application of concept lists for the purpose of language comparison."

For example, Gudschinsky introduces dashed labels (like ""fat-grease"") in those cases where Swadesh had put one of the items in brackets (like ""fat (grease)""). This practice has led to some confusion in later work by scholars who would claim to use Swadesh's list of 200 items but who were in fact only referring to Gudschinsky's list."	186-200

However, the concept labels differ to some degree. Be it for reasons of space or for other reasons unknown to us, all additional information of the labels was removed, thus making it impossible to distinguish, for example, whether ""burn"" is aiming at the transitive or the intransitive version of the concept. Similar confusion is created by items like ""flesh"" (is it human, animal, serving as food, or referring to the substance of living creatures?), and ""rain"" (verb or noun?), which actually also occurs on the [second, supposedly less stable list](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100b) also attributed to Swadesh and reported in the same source."	6

Given the idiosyncratic structure of labeling which uses dash-symbols to label concepts with help of two glosses (e.g., ""hold-take"", ""meat-flesh""), it is much more likely that the source would use the [version published by Gudschinsky](:ref:Gudschinsky-1956-200). It is, not exactly identical with Gudschinsky's version of Swadesh's list of 200 items, since it uses slightly different concept labels in which, for example, question marks for interrogatives are omitted. In the mapping to our Concepticon, however, these minor modifications in the labels do not show up and all items are mapped to the same concept.

Despite the fact that this is no real concept list, we thought it would be useful to include it inour collection, since it illustrates one important purpose of concept lists: to provide an initial heuristic to search for probably related words.

This procedure for stability checking is different from the ones proposed by [Starostin (2007)](:ref:Starostin-2007-110), [Holman et al. (2008)](:ref:Holman-2008-40), and [Pozdniakov (2014)](:ref:Pozdniakov-2014-100a).	14

In contrast to the original ranking, it calculates the results by averaging them. Given that we know the original data underlying this list, the mapping to concept sets was carried out by comparing with our mapping of Starostin's ranked list. As a result, there are some mappings which may seem unintuitive (""ground"" being mapped to ""EARTH (SOIL)""), but they result from different translations from the Russian source into English, not from wrong mappings.  200"	202

Swadesh-1955-215	Swadesh, Morris	1955		100	ranked	English	Global		Swadesh1955	Swadesh1955	Apart from Swadesh's most famous concept list of [100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), the article from 1955 gives the full [list of 215 items](:ref:Swadesh-1950-215) first presented in [1950](:bib:Swadesh1955) in ranked form with stability percentages and assignment of all items to semantic fields. This list combines two tables in the paper, the table which groups the items according to categories, and the table showing the stabilities. Items marked with an asterisk refer to those 92 items which were later selected for the 100 item list (eight more items are only mentioned in the text but not included in the table). In some cases the concept labels slightly diverged in the two tables. This was indicated by adding the different concept label in the list on semantic categories (page 133) to the main field and separating it by a back slash.	133-137

The stability was determined with help of the ranking procedure that was also underlying [Starostin's ranked list of 110 items](:ref:Starostin-2007-110). The list does not mechanically derive from the ranked list, but contains some concepts which were chosen for pragmatic reasons. The concept ""liver"", for example, was excluded, although it is very stable, but since it is not often not included in language surveys and available wordlists."	113

In contrast to most of the other concept lists in our sample, it is thus oriented towards basic concepts for language learning, rather than basic concepts for language comparison.	62	
Trask-2000-15	Trask, Robert L.	2000		15	ultra-stable	English	Global		Trask2000	Trask2000	"According to the author, this list is the [15-item list by Dolgopolsky (1964)](:ref:Dolgopolsky-1964-15). It deviates, however, both in the concept labels which were used in the [English translation from 1986](:bib:Dolgopolsky1986) and in the literal translation of Dolgopolsky's list. It is therefore much more likely that Trask quoted Dolgopolsky's list intermediately from [Shevoroshkin's list of 23 items](:ref:Shevoroshkin-1991-23). Since this list is again a rather specific translation of Dolgopolsky's list, it explains why Trask's list of Dolgopolsky and Dolgopolsky's list deviate in the item ""louse"" which Trask (following Shevoroshkin) translates as ""louse/nit""."	96

According to the compiler, the selection of the words was based on a comparison of proposed concept lists (e.g. by [Jakhontov](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-35), [Dolgopolsky](:ref:Dolgopolsky-1964-15), and [Holman](:ref:Holman-2008-40)) along with a test of the performance of the words in producing senseful language trees based on the algorithm proposed by the eLinguistics.net project.

Unfortunately, the only source which we could find for this list, [Hymes (1960)](http:bibliography.lingpy.org?key=Hymes1960), presents the concept glosses in an abbreviated form which does not allow us to distinguish whether we are dealing with verbal or nominal meanings. As a confusing result of this, the concept ""rain"" occurs twice, both in this [stable list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1960-100a) (item 76) and in this supplementary list (item 121)."	6

The first two Swadesh lists originally make up about 207 items, but since the compilers further split five items into two sets, the ""Swadesh part"" of the list consists of 212 items in total. For this reason, the complete list contains 333 items. The compilers give further specifications of some of their concepts which we added in an additional column called ANNOTATION. Since many of these specifications are, however, optional, they were not entirely considered to carry out the mapping."

The database was used for multiple studies and inspired the creation of IELex as a successor database, with an [expanded list of 207 concepts](:ref:Dunn-2012-207). Regarding the intended concepts, the list is entirely identical with [Swadesh's 200 item list](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200). Regarding the concept labels, however, the list shows some slight differences. For a ranked version of this list, based on the inferred stability of words in a phylogenetic analysis, see the list by [Pagel et al. (2007)](:ref:Pagel-2007-200).		
Dunn-2012-207	Dunn, Michael	2012		207	basic	English	Indo-European	http://ielex.mpi.nl/meanings/	Dunn2012		This list of 207 items used in the [Indo-European Lexical Cognacy Database](http://ielex.mpi.nl) is a close but not exact merger of [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and his [list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). It is not exact, since transitive and intransitive forms of the verb to burn which occur separately in the initial lists, are merged into one item. This list is also used as the basic list behind the [Wiktionary Swadesh Lists](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Spanish_Swadesh_list) (see the [Wiktionary swadesh list](:ref:Wiktionary-2003-207)).

Buck-1949-1108	Buck, Carl Darling	1949		1108	questionnaire	English	Indo-European		Buck1949	Buck1949	This famous resource on words of similar meanings in Indo-European languages was the basis for later large word list collections like [WOLD (Haspelmath and Tadmor 2009)](:ref:Haspelmath-2009-1460), and [IDS (Key and Comrie 2015)](:ref:Key-2016-1310). Due lack of resources we are not able to provide a list which was fully digitized from the book, but had to rely on the index in the end of the book, and a semi-automatic comparison with the list by Haspelmath and Tadmor. A larger amount of concepts was also left unlinked, since they seem to be too specific to justify their inclusion in this resource at the moment. So when using this list for important studies, we recommend to check with the original to make sure there are no errors. If errors are detected, we further appreciate to be notified via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/concepticon/concepticon-data).	1505-1515	Buck
Dyen-1964-154	Dyen, Isidore	1964		154	ranked	English	Indo-European		Dyen1964	Dyen1964	This list represents the original [list of 200 items by Swadesh](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) which was ranked by comparing the amount of cognate pairs found in 39 Indo-European languages, with items of low ranks representing items which have a high amount of cognate pairs when comparing all languages in a pairwise fashion. The author gives also a [ranked list for Malayo-Polynesian languages](:ref:Dyen-1964-196). Since the majority of languages was taken from [Buck's (1949) dictionary](:bib:Buck1949), and the author had problems in covering all meanings of the 200 item list, the list was reduced to 154 items. Of the 154 items, however, only 153 appear in the ranking, due to a typesetting error with a missing concept for rank 133.	242f

Hattori-1961-236	Hattori, Shirō	1961		236	basic	English	Japanese dialects		Hattori1961	Hattori1961	This concept list was the basis for several lexicostatistical studies of the Japanese dialects. The list diverges from [Swadesh's list of 200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) especially in that the author lists additional alternatives for certain of the test items (numbered as *a* and *b*). This list itself was published already earlier than the source we quote here ([Hattori 1954](:bib:Hattori1954)). We quote the later list for practical reasons, since it is taken from a text written in English, and our team currently lacks Japanese speaking colleagues.	 55f

The concept ""at"" also occurs (suprisingly) two times in their list, both times with other reflexes in the data.

Strictly speaking, the list itself contains much less conceptual items than 173, since the authors list items which are expressed by multiple cognate sets in the languages of California separately. In order to get these cognate sets, they used a list of 225 English words which is, unfortunately, not reported in the study. According to the authors, the list of cognate sets contains 175 items, but in the source, only 171 items are listed, with 2 further being labeled as secondary in the source. In order to keep close to the original, we decided to add their concept list in unmodified form to the concepticon.	56-61

Items marked with an asterisk and a dollar sign appear in the 100-item and 200-item lists, respectively. The reasons for the exclusion of concepts were both pragmatic (absence of concepts in the languages under investigation), and theoretical (ambiguity in the target languages).		
Bowern-2012-189	Bowern, Claire and Atkinson, Quentin D.	2012		189	basic	English	Pama-Nyungan		Bowern2012	Bowern2012	This is a basic vocabulary list which was used for a study on Pama-Nyungan languages, originally, the list was larger, containing [204 items](:ref:Bowern-2012-205), but items were excluded since some concepts were hard to translate and other concepts were not independent (showing colexifications). A similar list was used for a [study on hunter gatherer languages](:ref:Bowern-2011-204). Words which do not occur in the [Swadesh 100](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) or [200](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) lists are marked by an asterisk.	825f

It was inspired by an earlier version of the [210 item list of Blust](:ref:Blust-2008-210). Later on, the authors decided to reduce the list by 15 items, since they turned out to be hard to find in for all languages in the sample, or since the were depended in two many languages which would have the same word for two different concepts. Note that the list itself is supposed to have only 204 concepts, but in the source, the authors list 205, with the concept ""thou"" occuring twice, one time as ""you.SG"" and one time as ""thou"". The items which were excluded are marked with a cross in the column named EXCLUDED. Words which do not occur in the [Swadesh 100](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) or [200](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) lists are marked by an asterisk.

Mallory-2006-100	Mallory, James Patric and Adams, Douglas Quentin	2006		100	basic, proto-language	English	Proto-Indo-European		Mallory2006	Mallory2006	This list is an attempt by the authors to translate the [Swadesh's list of 100 concepts](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100) to Proto-Indo-European. Given the Indo-European translations provided by the authors as well as their concept labels, the list is not completely identical with the one by Swadesh, although it comes very close. We have tried to include all Indo-European readings which are also given in the source, but do not list the reflexes in the major branches which are also provided by the authors.	97-99

Given the semantic divergence in the items, we had difficulties in mapping them all sufficiently. For the sake of simplicity, only the first item of two semantically very different items was mapped, if it was separated by a semi-colon in the source. Surprisingly, the item ""leg, foot"" appears two times in the list, but it does not seem to be an error."	227-236

Inspired by [Matisoff's CALMSEA list](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200) containing concepts which are ""Culturally and Linguistically Meaningful for Southeast Asia"", but not necessarily for other language areas, Heggarty calls this list the CALMA list (""Culturally and Linguistically Meaningful for the Andes""). Apart from the raw list data, the data provided by the author also contains additional columns in which this new list is compared with earlier concept lists, like the two lists proposed by Swadesh ([100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), and [200 items](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200)), and the short list proposed by [Yakhontov (35 items)](:ref:Yakhontov-1991-35)."

Note that the list itself was produced long before Swadesh published his first concept lists (Swadesh [1950](:bib:Swadesh1950), [1952](:bib:Swadesh1952)). It is not easy to interprete what the author intends to say in the paper, but it seems that his approach was partially inspired by Swadesh due to personal communication, but also by an article by [Kroeber and Chrétien (1937)](:bib:Kroeber1937).	480f

The authors note in the paper that they reduced the list to 96 items (without specifying further reasons), but it seems they excluded 5 items in the end, at least this is the number of words we could identify in their supplementary material. The list contains some deviations from Swadesh's original list, with the most pregnant one being the concept ""fly (noun)"" which is marked as a verb in Swadesh's original list."

This list was published in many different references. We quote here the earliest version we could find ([Woodward 1978](:bib:Woodward1978) doesn't contain a full list).

As a result, Chinese was identified as the first outgroup. The list is without doubt based on [Swadeshs list of 100 items](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100), yet the concept labels differ to some extent. Benedict mentions another source (Burlin 1971) upon which the list is based, but this source could so far not been inspected.	168

Note, that, although this list should actually be based on the larger comparative list of 500 items in the same reference, the concept labels diverge in part from the ones used in the larger list.

Trick-1983-100	Trick, Doug	1983		100	basic	English	Southern Philippine		Trick1983	Trick1983	This list was used for a lexicostatistical comparison of four languages spoken on the Catanduanes Island. The list originally contained 110 items, whose origin is not further specified in the report, but was reduced to 100 items due to problems of finding good and unambiguous translations for the concepts.

The list is based on [Matisoff's CALMSEA list](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200), yet it shows some peculiarities, such as the numbering of the items and some concept labels. The author also explains that certain items were removed, since they could not be found in the language variety under investigation. Note further that the numbering of the list is potentially erroneous, since the list jumps from 117 directly to 121.	91-93	
SatterthwaitePhillips-2011-423	Satterthwaite-Phillips, Damian	2011		423	questionnaire	English, Chinese	Tibeto-Burman		SatterthwaitePhillips2011	SatterthwaitePhillips2011	This is an expanded meaning list combining parts of the lists proposed by [Matisoff 1987](:ref:Matisoff-1978-200) and the well known lists of [Swadesh (1952](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200) and [1955)](:ref:Swadesh-1955-100). Note that although the author mentions in his thesis on page 44 that a total of 410 words (meanings) were used to collect the data, we find as many as 423 words, including some duplicate entries, but also some entries which are obviously near synonyms but were probably split into different semantic slots by the author (who himself marks seven additional entries as not belonging to the original concept). The ENGLISH column reflects the concept glosses as listed in Appendix 1 of the work, while the SPREADSHEET column reflects the concept glosses as used in an excel spreadsheet containing the raw data which the author was so friendly to provide us. Entries marked with an asterisk in the SPREADSHEET column seem to reflect items which also occur on traditional concept lists; entries ending on the percentage character are those marked as later added by the author in the original source. Why some entries in the SPREADSHEET column are marked with two greater-then characters in the spreadsheet data of the author is not entirely clear to us, but we kept it in order to provide all information that is available.	176-239

It was initially based on [Dyen's 200-item dataset](:ref:Dyen-1992-200), identical to [Swadesh's list (1952)](:ref:Swadesh-1952-200), but, for the purpose of the study, was reduced to 100 concepts with the highest stability measures. As pointed out by the authors, the list does not make use of any historical information such as cognacy. Instead, it is designed to compare words with the same meaning for computing lexical distances between lexemes and establishing relationships among languages without the need for historical input.	1-10

As reported by the authors, it resulted from clustering words from [massive text corpora](:bib:Brysbaert2014) into 180 semantic groups, covering the entire semantic space of the corpora. The most representative concepts, manually selected from each cluster, were then used as input stimuli in three fMRI experiments in order to investigate the relationship between the linguistic representations and the resulting imaging data. The researchers report that semantic information is not confined to a specific brain region, as commonly assumed, but rather distributed across several high-level cortical networks.	1-13

The data for this study come from the database compiled by the NonCanCase project at the University of Bergen and the EVALISA project at Ghent University and represent twelve cognate sets of predicates with dative- and accusative-subject marking from Proto-Germanic to the modern languages. Additionally, the dataset contains the information on the chronological order of the cases, assigned to the subject by each verb.	e1-e22	
Stoll-1884-259	Stoll, Otto	1884		259	basic	German	Mayan languages		Stoll1884		This list underlies the comparative study of the 16 Mayan languages, spoken outside the Republic of Guatemala. Its vocabulary was originally compiled and the corresponding data were collected by Berendt around the middle of the 19th century, later published by Stoll in 1884 with minor modifications. The languages are ordered according to the degree of their relatedness to the Mayan family, starting from the most genetically remote variety. It is also worth noting that the variety of Chol, recorded by Berendt, is reported to have undergone some significant changes after the point of its documentation.
