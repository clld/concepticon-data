## Grant information

The Concepticon resource is the result of ongoing efforts which date back to
early 2012. Without the generous support of many different funding agencies, we
would not have been able to carry out this research. The table below lists, who
has profited during which time periods from what research projects awarded by
which funding agency.

## People

Many people helped us in many
ways in assembling the data. They pointed us to missing
lists (M), provided scans (S), digitized data (D), typed off
and corrected concept lists (C), provided translations (T),
linked concept lists (L), provided corrections of concept definitions and concept linkings (P), or gave important advice (A), and (G) contributed new data via the GitHub-Workflow. 

For all this help, we are very grateful and express our gratitude.
